            This is a platform to aid a community of people to manage their time
            efficiently as they spend time in the kitchen with recipes that can
            fit specific lifestyles. We here a Mealtime are here to come
            together with individuals out there in the wild world to free
            themselves from their kitchens.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, here at Mealtime we'd love to hear from you, to do
            that head over to resources to let us hear from you, your thoughts,
            suggestions, and dreams for Mealtime going forward. We'd love to
            hear from you :).
